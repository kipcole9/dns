  # 6.1.  OPT Record Definition
  #
  # 6.1.1.  Basic Elements
  #
  #    An OPT pseudo-RR (sometimes called a meta-RR) MAY be added to the
  #    additional data section of a request.
  #
  #    The OPT RR has RR type 41.
  #
  #    If an OPT record is present in a received request, compliant
  #    responders MUST include an OPT record in their respective responses.
  #
  #    An OPT record does not carry any DNS data.  It is used only to
  #    contain control information pertaining to the question-and-answer
  #    sequence of a specific transaction.  OPT RRs MUST NOT be cached,
  #    forwarded, or stored in or loaded from master files.
  #
  #    The OPT RR MAY be placed anywhere within the additional data section.
  #    When an OPT RR is included within any DNS message, it MUST be the
  #    only OPT RR in that message.  If a query message with more than one
  #    OPT RR is received, a FORMERR (RCODE=1) MUST be returned.  The
  #    placement flexibility for the OPT RR does not override the need for
  #    the TSIG or SIG(0) RRs to be the last in the additional section
  #    whenever they are present.
  #
  # 6.1.2.  Wire Format
  #
  #    An OPT RR has a fixed part and a variable set of options expressed as
  #    {attribute, value} pairs.  The fixed part holds some DNS metadata,
  #    and also a small collection of basic extension elements that we
  #    expect to be so popular that it would be a waste of wire space to
  #    encode them as {attribute, value} pairs.
  #
  #    The fixed part of an OPT RR is structured as follows:
  #
  #        +------------+--------------+------------------------------+
  #        | Field Name | Field Type   | Description                  |
  #        +------------+--------------+------------------------------+
  #        | NAME       | domain name  | MUST be 0 (root domain)      |
  #        | TYPE       | u_int16_t    | OPT (41)                     |
  #        | CLASS      | u_int16_t    | requestor's UDP payload size |
  #        | TTL        | u_int32_t    | extended RCODE and flags     |
  #        | RDLEN      | u_int16_t    | length of all RDATA          |
  #        | RDATA      | octet stream | {attribute,value} pairs      |
  #        +------------+--------------+------------------------------+
  #
  #    The variable part of an OPT RR may contain zero or more options in
  #    the RDATA.  Each option MUST be treated as a bit field.  Each option
  #    is encoded as:
  #
  #                   +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
  #        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  #     0: |                          OPTION-CODE                          |
  #        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  #     2: |                         OPTION-LENGTH                         |
  #        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  #     4: |                                                               |
  #        /                          OPTION-DATA                          /
  #        /                                                               /
  #        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  #
  #    OPTION-CODE
  #       Assigned by the Expert Review process as defined by the DNSEXT
  #       working group and the IESG.
  #
  #    OPTION-LENGTH
  #       Size (in octets) of OPTION-DATA.
  #
  #    OPTION-DATA
  #       Varies per OPTION-CODE.  MUST be treated as a bit field.
  #
  #    The order of appearance of option tuples is not defined.  If one
  #    option modifies the behaviour of another or multiple options are
  #    related to one another in some way, they have the same effect
  #    regardless of ordering in the RDATA wire encoding.
  #
  #    Any OPTION-CODE values not understood by a responder or requestor
  #    MUST be ignored.  Specifications of such options might wish to
  #    include some kind of signaled acknowledgement.  For example, an
  #    option specification might say that if a responder sees and supports
  #    option XYZ, it MUST include option XYZ in its response.
  #
  # 6.1.3.  OPT Record TTL Field Use
  #
  #    The extended RCODE and flags, which OPT stores in the RR Time to Live
  #    (TTL) field, are structured as follows:
  #
  #                   +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
  #        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  #     0: |         EXTENDED-RCODE        |            VERSION            |
  #        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  #     2: | DO|                           Z                               |
  #        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  #
  #    EXTENDED-RCODE
  #       Forms the upper 8 bits of extended 12-bit RCODE (together with the
  #       4 bits defined in [RFC1035].  Note that EXTENDED-RCODE value 0
  #       indicates that an unextended RCODE is in use (values 0 through
  #       15).
  #
  #    VERSION
  #       Indicates the implementation level of the setter.  Full
  #       conformance with this specification is indicated by version '0'.
  #       Requestors are encouraged to set this to the lowest implemented
  #       level capable of expressing a transaction, to minimise the
  #       responder and network load of discovering the greatest common
  #       implementation level between requestor and responder.  A
  #       requestor's version numbering strategy MAY ideally be a run-time
  #       configuration option.
  #       If a responder does not implement the VERSION level of the
  #       request, then it MUST respond with RCODE=BADVERS.  All responses
  #       MUST be limited in format to the VERSION level of the request, but
  #       the VERSION of each response SHOULD be the highest implementation
  #       level of the responder.  In this way, a requestor will learn the
  #       implementation level of a responder as a side effect of every
  #       response, including error responses and including RCODE=BADVERS.
  #
  # 6.1.4.  Flags
  #
  #    DO
  #       DNSSEC OK bit as defined by [RFC3225].
  #
  #    Z
  #       Set to zero by senders and ignored by receivers, unless modified
  #       in a subsequent specification.
